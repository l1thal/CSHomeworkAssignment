For each problem, identify who is going to be the lead programmer for the main methods, who is going to write some of the custom methods, and who is going to write the report about the code. Each person on the team should get to be the lead on one of the three problems.

 

A different option is the code off option. All three of you do the same problem. Whoever gets done first wins. Then the other two have to tie their work in to the winner's code.  The winner gets to pick the second and third problem for the second and third place to go and work on.

 

Each individual should turn in their individual report.

Their report should include a graphic showing how GitHub has been used.
